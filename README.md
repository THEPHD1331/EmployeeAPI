# EmployeeAPI

I conceived and realized a robust Employee REST CRUD API project using Spring Boot. This project centers around the essential entity, "Employee," while being fortified with Spring Security for role-based access control. It efficiently manages Employee records and grants varying privileges based on user roles, catering to Administrators, Managers, and Employees.


# Key Features:

Entity-Centric Design: 

The project adopts a meticulously designed entity model with a focus on the "Employee" entity. This model includes essential attributes such as name, contact information, and job details, ensuring a comprehensive representation of employee data.

CRUD Operations: 

The API offers comprehensive CRUD functionality, enabling Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for Employee records. This empowers users to manage employee information with ease and precision.

Spring Security for Role-Based Access Control:

Spring Security is seamlessly integrated to enforce role-based access control. The system assigns three distinct roles - Administrator, Manager, and Employee - each with specific privileges:

Administrator: Has the authority to delete employees in addition to Manager-level tasks.

Manager: Can update and delete employees in addition to Employee-level tasks.

Employee: Can read (view) employee information.

Secure Authentication: Robust authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure secure access to the API. Users are required to authenticate themselves using username and password credentials.

RESTful Architecture:

The API adheres to RESTful architectural principles, offering logically structured endpoints with standardized HTTP methods. This ensures a user-friendly and predictable interaction pattern for clients.

Documentation: 

I have meticulously documented the API endpoints using tools like Swagger. This documentation simplifies API consumption, accelerates developer onboarding, and promotes collaborative development efforts.

By crafting this Employee REST CRUD API project, I honed my skills in Spring Boot, REST API development, database design, and security implementation.
